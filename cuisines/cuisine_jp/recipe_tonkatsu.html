    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Tonkatsu recipe uses thinly sliced boneless pork chops and panko, which are Japanese bread crumbs that are really light and airy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon milk</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>8 thin cut boneless pork chops</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups panko crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine eggs, milk, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well mixed. Heat oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Place panko crumbs in a shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Dip pork chops in egg mixture, then coat with panko crumbs; dip in the egg mixture again, then coat with another layer of panko crumbs. Lay coated chops on a plate until the rest are finished. If you have time, let them set for about 10 minutes, and the coating will set very well.</li>
      <li>When oil is very hot, place pork chops into the pan, and fry for about 5 minutes on each side, until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
